# Next.js, React context & Material UI exercises

## Task 1

Checkout the context.js file in the root folder of the project and make sure to that the onCookieBarClose function is correctly passed to the global state (React context).

## Task 2

In the <CookieBar /> component add a prop called onAccept and call that prop-function when clicking the button.

## Task 3

In the index.js file. Get the onCookieBarClose function from the global state and pass it as a prop to the <CookieBar />

## Task 4

Use Material UI and make the /posts/[id].js page look a little bit nicer!
For example you could use `<Typography>` component for the title and the body and then use the `<Container>` element as a wrapper.
Take a look inside the <CookieBar /> component for how it's used.

## Task 5 (Bonus)

Explore Next.js and Material UI further and start expanding your blog project (this project).
